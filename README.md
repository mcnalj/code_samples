These are a sample of the JavaScript algorithms I created while working towards the Front End Developer
certification at Free Code Camp. One converts integers to Roman numerals. Another tranlates into pig Latin.
The third takes two integers and returns the sum of all prime numbers between the two integers.
Thank you for your interest!
